        <h1>Welcome to my blog</h1>
        <p> I am motivation. I am that inner voice that whispers to you not to give up.
            The one that helps you get back up when everything seems blurry.
            I am your inner fire, the strength that lights your path, the one that guides you toward your dreams.
            I am there when you hesitate.
            When your alarm rings and you want to stay in bed.
            When others doubt you, but you persevere anyway.
            I am motivation. And as long as you listen to me, nothing can stop you.
